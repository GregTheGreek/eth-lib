## Eth-Lib

Lightweight Ethereum libraries. This is a temporary repository which will be used as the basis of an implementation on Idris (or similar).

Edit: please, don't use this lib. I worked on it for a few days and stopped to create Formality. Eventually I'll make Ethereum libraries in Formality and compile them to JavaScript. Right now, if you need Ethereum stuff on the browser, consider alternatives (web3, ethers, ethereumjs, etc.).
